# symbolic-equation-solver
A genetic programming application to solve linear and quadratic equations symboliclly

# To run the linear equation solver, use this instruction inside the main() method of the GeneticProgrammingSymbolicEquationSolverApp class:
        (new LinearEquationGeneticProgammingSolver()).solve();

# To run the quadratic equation solver, use this instruction inside the main() method of the GeneticProgrammingSymbolicEquationSolverApp class:
        (new SquareEquationGeneticProgrammingSolver()).solve();
