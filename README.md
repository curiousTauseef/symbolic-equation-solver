# symbolic-equation-solver
A genetic programming application to solve linear and quadratic equations symbolically

# Running process:

* To run the linear equation solver, use this instruction inside the main() method of the GeneticProgrammingSymbolicEquationSolverApp class:
        
        (new LinearEquationGeneticProgammingSolver()).solve();

* To run the quadratic equation solver, use this instruction inside the main() method of the GeneticProgrammingSymbolicEquationSolverApp class:
        
        (new SquareEquationGeneticProgrammingSolver()).solve();

* Result: (for the SquareEquationSolver, it takes much time to find the exact result, so an approximation of the result has been given)
